        <h2>my sweet baby,</h2>
        <p>
    happy valentines day! you have no idea how badly i wish that you were here with me today. i wish i could have done so much more for you, because you deserve all the flowers, all the love and all the kisses i could possible ever give, but the circumstances just never seem to be on our side.
  </p>

  <p>
    being apart from you is killing me but you’re with me in some little way every second of every day. you're in my room through every little thing that you've given me, you're the first thing i see when i pick up my phone in the morning, i carry you around with your hairtie that never leaves my wrist, and everywhere i go i'm always asked about how my favorite girl's doing.
  </p><br>

  <p>
    i miss you dearly. i wish things were easier, but i see that you're doing your thing day in and day out and i'm very proud of you baby. you're doing so well and i hope it only ever gets easier. i love you so much and i know i never asked to be your valentine but for what it's worth i hope you know that you're the only i want, day in and day out and i love you with everything in me.
  </p><br>

  <p>
    i miss your smile and i miss walking around with you and cuddling you and kissing you and being goofy together. i wish on every star that those days would come back as soon as they can. i might get busy but that doesn't stop me from yearning for you. you're cool like that, always in my mind. the one thing that's constant.
  </p><br>

  <p>
    i love you. that's all you need to know. and i miss you so very much. happy valentine's day, i hope your days are always as beautiful as you are.
